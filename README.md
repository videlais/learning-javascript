## What This Is (and Isn't)

The word "Learning" in *Learning JavaScript ES6* is purposeful. This **is not** an exhaustive list of everything in JavaScript and how to use it.

As a language, new functionality gets added every year. Different programming patterns also emerge or fade away over time.

This book *tries* to outline and review major functionality in JavaScript ES6. While early chapter review fundamental concepts in JavaScript, most of the book serves as a reference to functionality with examples of how it could be used.
