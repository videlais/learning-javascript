## Conventions

This book uses some style conventions. Properties are give *emphasis*. Objects are given **strong emphasis**. While code may sometimes appear inline `like this`, most will be given in code blocks like the following:

```javascript
console.log("Hi!");
```

Any use of HTML will also within code blocks and may appear like the following: `<html>`.

As special character such the semicolon, `;`, are discussed as part of writing code, they will also appear in a block style.

## Introducing ES6

JavaScript has two main branches: ES5 and ES6 (and later). The letters used in "ES5" and "ES6" stand for the specification that defines the language: ECMAScript.

Before 1994, the European Computer Manufacturers Association introduced and maintained specifications for programming languages, protocols, and other, related technologies across Europe. If something software related interacted with some other software, it was regulated in part through the European Computer Manufacturers Association and rules it helped develop with its partner companies and organizations.

Starting in 1994, the European Computer Manufacturers Association became simply the letters ECMA to better reflect the global nature of its organization and partners. Around the same time, parts of JavaScript were appearing as early as 1995, but its first official version was in 1997. This was also when it became part of ECMA and under its combined governance.

While new functionality was added to JavaScript from time to time based on suggestions from companies and organizations, in 2015 it was decided to move JavaScript to its 6th edition. This version, technically called ECMAScript 2015, marked a clear dividing point between early JavaScript and modern conventions and syntax. Because of its sixth edition, it became known as JavaScript ES6 (JavaScript - ECMAScript, 6th Edition).

Starting in 2015, it was also decided that a new version of JavaScript would come out every year instead of in parts every few years. Since then, JavaScript ES10 (ECMAScript 2019), has come out and new functions and keywords have been added.

## Differences between ES5 and ES6

Within the JavaScript programming community, everything that has been added since 2015 is commonly called part of "JavaScript ES6." Anything from before that point is part of "JavaScript ES5."

Starting in 2016, all modern web browsers started supporting parts of JavaScript ES6 with more functionality added every year. At the same time, Node.js, since it is a single set of tools, often has support for cutting-edge parts of JavaScript in its newest versions before they become official for testing purposes.

## Node.js Preferred

While most functionality will work in browsers, it is strongly recommended to use Node.js, a command-line tool with the examples and code in this book.

**Note:** As this book is primarily on JavaScript itself, instructions are not included for how to install Node.js. However, it can be found on its [website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
